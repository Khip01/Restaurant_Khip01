## Feature
Maybe feature in this Information System is all about **Create, Read, Update, and Delete, no more**. <br>
But this an simple implementation of API, which can be used as a bridge between databases and different application platforms.

## Instruction:
- Clone this repo.
- [DATABASE] In your database, create database named  **db_Restaurant_Khip01** (or you can change the name in setup.go). Then Migrate it with ```go run main.go``` on your terminal.
- [DESKTOP APP] You can open .sln file/run it.
- [MOBILE APP] Just run the application via vscode/terminal.

> IMPORTANT \
> There is important to change your datasource(dsn) address in ```setup.go``` file, according to your needs.
